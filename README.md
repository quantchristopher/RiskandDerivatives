# RiskandDerivatives
This repository contains samples of my coding history written in the R and Excel/VBA languages. 
Each file pertains to various topics in quantitative finance ranging from derivative contract pricing, 
financial asset return profiling, risk parameterization, risk management, discounted cash flow modeling,
and portfolio construction/optimization. It has been my intention to provide most files with extensive 
commentary regarding the actions each line or function of code performs - and it is my hope that the reader
finds these comments insightful towards understanding the goal of the process.

Enjoy!
